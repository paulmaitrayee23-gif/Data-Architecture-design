Section A: Limitations of RDBMS

Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) face several challenges when dealing with modern, dynamic applications. In a product catalog, different products often have different attributes. For example, laptops may have RAM and processor details, while clothing items may have size and fabric information. In RDBMS, handling such varying attributes becomes difficult because the schema is fixed. Adding new attributes requires altering the table structure, which is time-consuming and risky, especially when the database is large.Another limitation is frequent schema changes. When new product types are introduced, multiple ALTER TABLE operations are needed, which can affect performance and stability. Additionally, storing nested data such as customer reviews is inefficient in RDBMS. Reviews usually contain ratings, comments, timestamps, and user details, which require multiple tables and joins. This increases query complexity and reduces performance. Due to these limitations, RDBMS struggles with flexible, evolving, and nested data structures.

Section B: NoSQL Benefits (MongoDB)

MongoDB effectively overcomes the limitations of relational databases through its flexible, document-based design. Unlike RDBMS, MongoDB allows a flexible schema, meaning each product can have its own set of attributes. This makes it easy to store different types of products such as electronics, clothing, and groceries without changing the database structure. MongoDB also supports embedded documents. Customer reviews can be stored directly inside the product document, including ratings, comments, and timestamps. This reduces the need for multiple tables and complex joins, improving query performance. Another advantage is horizontal scalability, where data can be distributed across multiple servers easily. This makes MongoDB suitable for large-scale applications with growing data. Overall, MongoDB provides better flexibility, performance, and scalability for handling dynamic and unstructured data compared to traditional relational databases.

Section C: Trade-offs (MongoDB vs MySQL)

Although MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability, it also has certain disadvantages compared to MySQL. One major drawback is the lack of strict relational constraints such as foreign keys, which can lead to data inconsistency if not handled properly at the application level. Additionally, MongoDB is not ideal for complex transactional operations that require strong ACID compliance across multiple tables. In scenarios where data relationships are highly structured and transactional integrity is critical, MySQL may be a better choice. Therefore, while MongoDB is powerful for flexible data models, it may not suit all use cases.
